Creating Custom Hooks 
    Toggle Hook
    One of the most common things youll do in apps is toggle some state
    This could be hiding some state, turning something on or off or moving something from one place to another
    We could repeat this logic over and over or we could use a hook (function) to do it for us

Hooks   
    Hooks should be in a separate hooks folder and all hooks should start their filename with use   
        useToggleState.js
